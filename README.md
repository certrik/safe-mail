> safe-mail is a Docker service to help security teams safely interact with msg, eml, and documents

## Synopsis

safe-mail is a Docker service used by analysts to upload, extract, and inspect suspicious .MSG, .EML, and documents.  safe-mail can be used locally on your workstation or can be deployed for shared (or dedicated) use.

safe-mail an API and a (limited) UI which allows a user to upload and retrieve artifacts generated by safe-mail.

safe-mail has the following features and functionality:

### Message Features

* Upload EML and MSG mail messages as well as Microsoft Office documents themselves
   * .MSG mail messages are Microsoft binary email format messages - typically from Microsoft Outlook clients
* Generates a PNG of the message itself named {file_name}.png
* Extracts all embedded & attached images/attachments within the email message
* Provides a OCR text file of the generated mail message
* Generates a JSON file representing the mail message headers

### Attachment/Document Features

* Extracts attachments of mail messages 
* Generates an image & PDF of each attachment
* Attempts to extract any identified Macros within attachments and creates a JSON file representing the Macro code base
* PDF Documents will generate output from [pdfid](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2009/03/31/pdfid/) & [pdfparser](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/) tools
* ZIP attachments will extract the zip and return any files within the zip


### Output

> All of the above data (if applicable) will be returned in a file named `{file_name}.zip` 

## Installation

First you can download safe-mail by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:swimlane/safe-mail.git
```

## Building Docker Image

You first need to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --force-rm -t safe-mail .
```

## Running the Docker Image

You can run the docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 7001:7001 -ti safe-mail 
```

## USAGE

You can use this docker image to upload via the API or the minimal front-end

### Using the Front End

![](images/front-end-entry.png)

You can upload files using the front-end by dragging and dropping or uploading by select the drag and drop zone.

You can access this front-end at the provided port number you selected when running the container.  

```
http://0.0.0.0:7001
```

Once the files are uploaded, you can then select to process the files using the `Process` button.  You will be redirected to another page which may contain a generated image of the uploaded file.  Additionally, you will see a `Download` button which you can then download all the generated and extracted information in a .zip file. This will return a `{file_name}.zip` file which contains the processed items details.

### Using the API

You can also upload mail messages (MSG & EML) and documents (see list below) using the API.

#### Uploading MSG Files

```python
import requests
import os

path = './my_message.msg'
outpath = './Downloads/output.zip'

url = 'http://0.0.0.0:7001/email'

files = {'file': open(path, 'rb')}
data = {'extension': 'msg'}
res = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
f = open(outpath, 'w+')
f.write(res.content)
```

#### Uploading EML Files using Python

```python
import requests
import os

path = './my_message.eml'
outpath = './Downloads/output.zip'

url = 'http://0.0.0.0:7001/email'

files = {'file': open(path, 'rb')}
data = {'extension': 'eml'}
res = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
f = open(outpath, 'w+')
f.write(res.content)
```

#### Uploading EML Files using PowerShell

```powershell
$inFile = './tests/files/'
$inFileName = 'Phish Test - 1.eml'
$outFile = 'output.zip'
$URL = 'http://localhost:7001/email'

$fileBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($inFile + $inFileName);
$fileEnc = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding('UTF-8').GetString($fileBytes);
$boundary = [System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString(); 
$LF = "`r`n";

$bodyLines = ( 
    "--$boundary",
    "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=`"file`"; filename=`"$($inFileName)`"",
    "Content-Type: application/octet-stream$LF",
    $fileEnc,
    "--$boundary--$LF" 
) -join $LF

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $URL -Method Post -ContentType "multipart/form-data; boundary=`"$boundary`"" -Body $bodyLines -OutFile $outFile
```

##### Upload Documents & Files

```python
import requests
import os

path = './my_doc.docm'
outpath = './Downloads/output.zip'

url = 'http://0.0.0.0:7001/document'

files = {'file': open(path, 'rb')}
data = {'extension': 'docm'}
res = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
f = open(outpath, 'w+')
f.write(res.content)
```

## Supported Extensions

You can upload both MSG & EML files to either the front-end or to the `email` endpoint using the API.

Additionally, if you are using the `document` endpoint (or the UI front-end) safe-mail currently supports the following extensions but can possibly support additional files with testing.

* doc
* dot
* wbk
* docx
* docm
* dotx
* dotm
* docb
* xls
* xlt
* xlm
* xlsx
* xlsm
* xltx
* xltm
* xlsb
* xla
* xlam
* xll
* ppt
* pptx
